Issue 1: I forgot to add the .gitignore file earlier on the process, but I added it at the end so its still in the assignment.

Issue 2: I wasn't certain about the instructions to change the paragraph on the master branch. My understanding of the assignment was to add the paragraph tag in the content branch, which doesn't show up on the master branch because we didn't merge those two. For that section, I went ahead and added a paragraph tag with the instructed text. Upon merging content-test into the master I add to pick which content in the main tag had to be displayed. I went ahead and chose the content from the master branch since that came later in the assignment.
